# DailyPlanner
Welcome to my daily planner! Come enjoy a simple 9-5 agenda for your brief needs. All you need to do is type out whatever it is you want to remember, and click the save button. Then, as long as you clicked save, your notes will remain!

If the hour is grayed out, the hours have passed. You can still add notes for yourself and the notes won't disappear as long as you click save. The current hour is highlighted in yellow. All future hours are highlighted in green for your convenience. 

# The Works
This agenda is mostly powered by jquery and your notes are stored in your local storage. Don't worry! That means that no one else can see the notes you put on the agenda. There is a skeleton of an HTML and some CSS to make it look good, but it's mostly jquery.

# The display
Your agenda should look like the image below. Hope you enjoy using it!
